# JavaScript Clean Coding Best Practices

There are two things - Programming and Good Programming. Programming is what we have all been doing. Now is the time to do good programming. We all know that even the bad code works, but it takes time and resources to make a program good. Moreover, other developers mock you when they are trying to find what all is happening in your code. But it’s never too late to care for your programs.

### Characteristics of Clean code:

1. It should be elegant — Clean code should be pleasing to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed car would.
2. Clean code is focused — Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.
3. Clean code is taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.
4. Contains no duplication
5. Minimize the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.
